# This contains the CL specific constraints for synthesis at the CL level

# Add F1 specific constraints here -- constraints common to different FPGA host
# platforms should be generated during Golden Gate compilation to ensure
# portability.  See XDCAnnotation + WriteXDCFile pass for more information.
